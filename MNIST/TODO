NORMALIZE
implementation calc_mean_std class based on tensors
method for calculating the average mean and std of the whole dataset (-> for Normalize)
check Normalize for output range ((-1,1) | tanh -- (0,1) | sigmoid) -> pref (-1,1) tanh for generator

FID
implementation of a FID measure class
as evaluation method

COMPARISON FRAMEWORK
first dataset: MNIST

TENSORBOARD
add graph for losses and FID

MNIST OFC
test dropout
reduce the batch normalisation for testing puposes
